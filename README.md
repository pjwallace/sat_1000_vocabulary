# SAT Advanced Vocabulary Practice

A desktop-based Python application for practicing advanced SAT-level vocabulary.  
The app presents words randomly, allows users to attempt recall, reveals definitions on demand, and tracks progress across a full vocabulary set.

This project is designed as a **flashcard-style learning tool**, emphasizing repetition and exposure rather than grading.
